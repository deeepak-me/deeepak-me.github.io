            Hey there, I'm Deepak, a simple guy from Kerala! ðŸŒ´ who loves to
            develop cool website and call himself a front end developer ðŸ¤“ðŸ’» .
            I'm that guy who drinks tea( chai ) like it's a renewable resource
            and adore using codes to turn ideas into reality.{" "}
            <br>
              When I'm not making websites look cooler than a polar bear in
              sunglasses, you'll find me binge-watching movies, screaming at
              football matches( forever a Madridista ), and chatting about all
              kinds of random stuff with my favorite peeps!ðŸš€
            </br>{" "}
            Let's sprinkle some frontend fairy dust together and create web
            wonders that'll make users go, "Whoa, that's slick!" ðŸ˜„âœ¨
          </p>
